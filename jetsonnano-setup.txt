Jetson-nano setup notes for desktop or headless mode.
Moises Soto

 Introduction.
This is a complete setup guide for the Nvidia Jetson nano system, 
it is mainly written with the purpose of being a personal reminder 
for future setups but also as a guide for anyone with the similar 
needs.

 Objective
The goal is to get the jetson nano running headless, powering it 
via the usb cable and operating it with a host machine either 
through ssh or a VNC server for a virtual desktop.


 Requirements.
1. The guide assumes you have a capable micro-sd card flashed with 
    a Jetson Nano developer kit image.
3. A jumper for the J-48 pin, and a compatible barrel-jack power 
    supply (only for the initial setup).
2. The peripherals to operate the Jetson Nano in stand-alone mode, 
    (only for the initial configurations).
2. A usb cable with data capabilities as we will configure it 
    for headless mode and operate it via the host-machine it will 
    connect to.


 What it covers.
1. Fixing the dekstop sharing window error.
2. VNC setup.


 Installing the base system.
Attach a screen, mouse, keyboard, put a jumper in the J-48 pin 
(in front of barrel-jack) and turn on the Jetson Nano.
Proceed with the (graphical) installation normally.

After the instalation of the system it would be recommended to do 
	sudo apt update
	sudo apt upgrade

just to get everything in check but you could skip this part.


 Fixing the desktop sharing window error.

At this point if you tried opening the desktop sharing options 
you would get an error after a long pause. To fix this we need to 
edit the schema for the Vino binary in the following way

	sudo vim /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas/org.gnome.Vino.gschema.xml

and append the following key, (or add it at the begining before the 
first key for "prompt-enabled" begins)

    <key name='enabled' type='b'>
      <summary>Enable remote access to the desktop</summary>
      <description>
        If true, allows remote access to the desktop via the RFB 
        protocol. Users on remote machines may then connect to the 
        desktop using a VNC viewer.
      </description>
      <default>false</default>
    </key>

then compile the schemas with 

	sudo glib-compile-schemas /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas


VNC Setup.
At this point we can follow the README-vnc.txt which is included along with other files in the system documentation and should be mounted automatically under /media/username/L4-README

from README-vnc.txt

	sudo apt update
	sudo apt install vino

	# Enable the VNC server to start each time you log in
	sudo ln -s ../vino-server.service \
    	/usr/lib/systemd/user/graphical-session.target.wants

	# Configure the VNC server
	gsettings set org.gnome.Vino prompt-enabled false
	gsettings set org.gnome.Vino require-encryption false

	# Set a password to access the VNC server
	# Replace thepassword with your desired password
	gsettings set org.gnome.Vino authentication-methods "['vnc']"
	gsettings set org.gnome.Vino vnc-password $(echo -n 'thepassword'|base64)

	# Reboot the system so that the settings take effect
	sudo reboot

The VNC server is only available after you have logged in to Jetson locally. If
you wish VNC to be available automatically, use the system settings application
to enable automatic login.

The desktop resolution is typically determined by the capabilities of the
display that is attached to Jetson. If no display is attached, a default
resolution of 640x480 is selected. To use a different resolution, edit
/etc/X11/xorg.conf and append the following lines:

Section "Screen"
   Identifier    "Default Screen"
   Monitor       "Configured Monitor"
   Device        "Tegra0"
   SubSection "Display"
       Depth    24
       Virtual 1280 800 # Modify the resolution by editing these values
   EndSubSection
EndSection


To get more (and possibly updated) information please refer to README-vnc.txt

At this point we should be able to access the remote desktop.
Install a vncviewer on the host machine and access the jetson. 

If not connected to a network plug in the usb cable from the jetson 
to the host machine. The ip for the jetson is 192.168.55.1 and 
192.168.55.100 for the host by default, try pinging it from your host, 
if there is no response check that the host machine is connected to 
the new interface that was created when plugging the jetson to the 
host via usb.

Shutdown the jetson and remove all peripherals including the J-48 jumper, 
and only connect the usb to the host machine. 
Try accesing your VNC server as you did before.
